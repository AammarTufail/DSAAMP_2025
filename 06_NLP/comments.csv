"After graduating in Physics, I have been unemployed for 2 years. Recently, I started learning Python through Python ka Chilla by Codanics (Baba Ammar). Today is Day 4, and I am learning about Boxplots. This is my first time in any technical or IT field.
My old laptop is very slow, but I am determined to learn my first programming language. My goal is to enter the fields of AI and Data Science. At 25, I am facing unemployment and criticism from society, but I still have hope for better days.
Thank you, Sir, for your sincere efforts. May Allah bless you more and more."
