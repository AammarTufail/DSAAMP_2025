## 1. Making a Portfolio:
- **Portfolio**: A portfolio is a collection of your work that showcases your skills, projects, and achievements. It serves as a visual representation of your capabilities and can be used to impress potential employers or clients.
- **Importance**: A strong portfolio is essential for job seekers in the data science and AI fields. It demonstrates your practical experience, problem-solving abilities, and creativity. Employers often prefer candidates with a well-structured portfolio that highlights their best work.
- **How to Create a Portfolio**: 
  - Choose a platform (e.g., GitHub, personal website) to host your portfolio.
  - Select projects that showcase your skills and diversity in data science and AI.
  - Write clear descriptions for each project, including the problem statement, approach, and results.
  - Use visuals (charts, graphs) to enhance the presentation of your work.
  - Keep it updated with new projects and achievements.
- **Tips**:
  - Focus on quality over quantity. Choose a few standout projects rather than many mediocre ones.
  - Tailor your portfolio to the specific job or industry you're targeting.
  - Include links to your GitHub repositories, LinkedIn profile, and any relevant certifications.
  - Seek feedback from peers or mentors to improve your portfolio.

### 1.1. Portfolio Making using mkdocs:

- **mkdocs**: mkdocs is a static site generator that allows you to create beautiful documentation websites using Markdown. It is particularly useful for creating project portfolios, as it provides a simple way to organize and present your work.

Here is the complete guide to creating a portfolio using mkdocs-[Guide to make portfolio using Mkdocs](./01_portfolio/mkdocs-github-pages-guide.md)

## 2. Environments for Data Science and AI

Environments are isolated spaces where you can install packages and dependencies without affecting the global Python installation or other environments. Here you can see:
